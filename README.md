# ari_projects
Projects I've worked on or am currently developing. Usually for fun, sometimes for an actual purpose.

## 1. hadoop_proj_1 *(Needed to excercise my hadoop muscles again)*:
I've previously coded hadoop projects in Java, so I wanted to try implementing a mapred job in python. Referenced: https://medium.com/@rrfd/your-first-map-reduce-using-hadoop-with-python-and-osx-ca3b6f3dfe78
Ran into some issues with version mismatch but was able to resolve.
### Files:
* daily.csv - input
* test.csv - testing input
* hadoop_proj_1_notes - notes on implementation, changes, and commands for execution
* mapper.py - @robertdefilippi code
* reducer.py - @robertdefilippi code

## 2. lstm_projects *(Ongoing analysis)*:
Developing LSTM models with Keras. 
### Files:
* Too many files to list..


## 3. murderpedia *(I have a True Crime addiction and want to build things...)*:
I'm a pretty huge True Crime addict. Like listening to podcasts and have ID channel on while I work kind of addict. Wanted to try my hand at pulling together a project from start to finish, but using data I'd find interesting, so here we are. Code currently pulls data from muderpedia.org website. Lots of stuff to do still..
### Files:
* ari_notes-murderpedia - random notes
* murderpedia_webscraper.ipynb - Jupyter notebook code for webscraper
