# ari_projects
Projects I've worked on or am currently developing. Usually for fun, sometimes for an actual purpose.

## 1. census_webscraper *(built with BeautifulSoup and Pandas)*:
Takes CSV file with customer addresses and scrapes American Census Finder website to find "Place Within State" or Authority Having Jusidiction associated to that address
### Files:
* fake_address_input.csv - example input
* output.csv - example output
* ari_notes-census_finder - random notes
* census_finder_webscraper.ipynb - Jupyter notebook code
* census_finder_webscraper.py - Python version of code

## 2. murderpedia *(I have a True Crime addiction and want to build things...)*:
I'm a pretty huge True Crime addict. Like listening to podcasts and have ID channel on while I work kind of addict. Wanted to try my hand at pulling together a project from start to finish, but using data I'd find interesting, so here we are. Code currently pulls data from muderpedia.org website. Lots of stuff to do still..
### To-Do: 
* Push data to a database
* conduct analysis
### Files:
* ari_notes-murderpedia - random notes
* murderpedia_webscraper.ipynb - Jupyter notebook code for webscraper
