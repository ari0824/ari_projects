1. Include following at top of file:
    #!/usr/bin/env python

2. before executing code run, in folder with python files: 
    chmod +x mapper.py
    chmod +x reducer.py
3. test output locally
    cat daily.csv|python mapper.py|python reducer.py

4. Installed hadoop:
    http://hanslen.me/2018/01/19/How-to-install-Hadoop-on-macOS-High-Sierra/

---- HADOOP

1. hstart
2. create hdfs 
3. move data to hdfs navigate to /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.1.2
    hdfs dfs -put /Users/arideltoro/Desktop/ari_projects/hadoop_proj_1/daily.csv daily

4. check if file exists:
    hdfs dfs -ls /daily

5. execute mapred job: navigate to /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.1.2

bin/hadoop jar /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.1.2/libexec/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-*streaming*.jar \
-file <full path to file>/mapper.py \
-mapper "python mapper.py" \
-file <full path to file>/reducer.py  \
-reducer "python reducer.py"  \
-input daily/daily.csv \
-output daily/output


5a. Check full path in terminal: pwd

6. Delete output if running again:
    hadoop fs -rm -r /user/arideltoro/daily/output

7. Check output:
    hdfs dfs -cat daily/output/*


-----Changes to note:

-Original code was built to for python, I had python 3 on server. Fixed code by changing from "print" to "print ()"
-python path wasn't correct, had to Change
